### Cloudflare Pages

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|

| **Custom Headers/Redirects** | 5 | First-class support |
| **Analytics** | 5 | Built-in Web Analytics free |
| **Environment Variables** | 5 | Excellent UI for secrets |
| **Cost** | 5 | Free tier is generous |
| **Maintenance** | 4 | Cloudflare maintains it |
| **Debugging** | 3 | Build logs less detailed |
| **Ecosystem Integration** | 3 | Separate from GitHub |
| **Domain Management** | 5 | Integrated with your domain |
| **Build Caching** | 4 | Smart caching |
| **Rollback Capability** | 5 | Instant rollbacks in UI |
| **Security** | 5 | DDoS protection included |
| **Team Collaboration** | 3 | Need Cloudflare accounts |

## Decision Matrix by Use Case

### Choose GitHub Pages if:
- [x] You want everything in one platform
- [x] You value simplicity over features
- [x] You're a solo developer
- [x] You don't need PR previews
- [ ] You need advanced routing/redirects
- [x] You want to avoid external dependencies

### Choose Cloudflare Pages if:
- [ ] You need the fastest possible site
- [x] You want PR preview deployments
- [x] You need analytics without adding code
- [x] You plan to use advanced features (redirects, headers)
- [x] You're already using Cloudflare for DNS
- [ ] You have a team that needs different permissions

## Recommendation for Cosilico

**Winner: GitHub Pages + Actions** (70 vs 83 points, but context matters)

### Reasoning:
1. **Simplicity wins** - For a relatively simple React site, GitHub Pages does everything needed
2. **Single platform** - Everything stays in GitHub where you're already working
3. **No external dependencies** - One less service to manage/auth into
4. **Good enough performance** - The CDN difference is marginal for your use case
5. **Free forever** - No risk of hitting limits
6. **Easy handoff** - If others contribute, they just need GitHub access

### The Cloudflare advantages you don't critically need:
- PR previews (nice but not essential for this project)
- Built-in analytics (can add if needed)
- Speed difference (minimal for a small React app)
- Advanced routing (basic React app doesn't need)

### Implementation Plan:
1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Configure build and deploy steps
3. Set up CNAME in Cloudflare to point to GitHub Pages
4. Done - automatic deployment on every push

The 13-point difference isn't worth the added complexity for this project.
